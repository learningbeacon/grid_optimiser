# grid_optimiser
A project for creating a platform for load balancing, microgrid reconfiguration, automation, safety and protection.

The main aims of the project are as follows:
1. Integrate Distributed generation sources with the main grid
2. Perform microgrid reconfiguration based on current conditions
3. Perform protection and safety operations automatically
4. Create user controllability and visulalisations

The workflow of the project is expected to be:
1. The sensor data has to be fetched from a custom platform into the system
2. Preprocessing the sensor date to convert to  specific format for use in the project
3. Evaluating the preprocessed data to achieve functionalities as above
4. Create disconnection sequences for the grid re-configuration.

The install script, specific HW/SW requirements are to be updated as the project progresses...... stay tuned..
